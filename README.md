AutoGame
========

Are you tired of looking for your wireless keyboard and mouse when bringing your gaming rig into the living room? Do you wish you could automatically launch steam in big picture mode when streaming games with [Parsec](https://parsec.app/)? Maybe you're just tired of opening [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) every time you connect your controller? If this is you, you're in the right spot!

AutoGame, put simply, will listen for system events and start your favorite game launcher at just the right moment.

Installation
============

***Note:** This app is only available for Windows.*

Download and run the latest installer from the [releases](https://github.com/jarrettgilliam/AutoGame/releases) page.

When AutoGame starts the first time it will show this window:

From here you can choose your game launcher, set it's installation path, add custom arguments, and choose when you want it to open. When you're done, click OK. Now AutoGame will run at startup and automatically minimize to the system tray.
