AutoGame
========

Are you tired of looking for your wireless keyboard and mouse when bringing your gaming rig into the living room? Do you wish you could automatically launch steam in big picture mode when streaming games with [Parsec](https://parsec.app/)? Maybe you're just tired of opening [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) everytime you connect your controller? If this is you, you're in the right spot!

AutoGame, put simply, will listen for system events and start your favorite game launcher at just the right moment.

Installation
============

***Note:** This app is only available for Windows 10.*

Download and run the latest installer from the [releases](https://github.com/jarrettgilliam/AutoGame/releases) page.

When AutoGame starts, it will automatically open in the system tray. Clicking the icon will show this window:
